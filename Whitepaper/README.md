# Lightweaver 2.0

> A modular orbital solar reflector and energy delivery system designed to refocus sunlight into controlled thermal zones for sustainable energy, terraforming, and post-carbon development.

Lightweaver is a decentralized solar amplifier architecture using space-based gimbaled reflectors to redirect concentrated sunlight to Earth or in-space targets. It is the spiritual successor to early experiments like Znamya and aims to deliver clean energy to any location on the planet, on demand.

**Core Features:**
- Orbital solar reflector array
- Onboard adaptive optics and gimbal control
- Terrestrial or offworld beam targeting
- Modular, scalable deployment (LEO, Lagrange, or Lunar orbit)
- Ground-based thermal harvesting for heat engines or direct photothermal use
