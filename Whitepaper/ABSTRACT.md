# Abstract: Lightweaver 2.0

In a world rapidly transitioning away from fossil fuels, Lightweaver proposes a decentralized orbital infrastructure to capture, focus, and deliver solar energy where it is needed most. Unlike traditional satellites, Lightweaver units are purpose-built to reflect sunlight onto specific terrestrial receivers or into orbit-based heat engines.

This technology has heritage in the failed but visionary Znamya projects of 1990s Russia, where orbital reflectors briefly lit parts of the Earth. Lightweaver improves on that vision with new materials, focus control systems, and high-precision attitude correction mechanisms.

This document outlines the physics, engineering, governance, and deployment strategy for Lightweaver 2.0, including design considerations for beam diameter, atmospheric diffraction, orbital decay, safety regulations, and potential terraforming applications.
