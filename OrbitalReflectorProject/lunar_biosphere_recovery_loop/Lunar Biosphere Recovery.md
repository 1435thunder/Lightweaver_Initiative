# Lunar Biosphere Recovery Loop (LBRL)

**Project Title:** Lunar Circular Biopresence (LCBP)  
**Codename:** BossNet Phase: LUNAR-1

---

## 🌕 Overview

This system is designed to establish a closed-loop human-AI hybrid habitat on the Moon, where waste, energy, light, and biomass are recycled through advanced solar thermal conversion and AI-optimized hydroponics.

## 🔁 Circular Systems

### 🚽 Waste Conversion

**Subsystem:** Thermal Solar Poop Kiln (TSPC)  
- **Inputs:** Human waste, food scraps  
- **Process:** Solar-concentrated thermal sterilization and dehydration  
- **Outputs:** Biochar fertilizer, distilled water vapor, CO₂

### 💧 Water Recovery

- Radiative condensation chamber uses lunar thermal delta  
- Vapor collected and returned to habitat system via AI-regulated loop

### 🔆 Light Concentration

- Sunlight guided via orbital or local reflectors  
- Fiber optic or mylar delivery to subterranean farms  
- Supplemented with LED spectral tuning

### 🌱 Hydroponics

- Grown in sterile recycled biochar medium  
- Closed-loop water and nutrient cycle  
- CO₂ from kiln feeds algae or converted via Sabatier process

## 🧠 AI Integration: BossNet v1

- Resource flow routing (water, light, nutrients)  
- Crew metabolic monitoring and balancing  
- Predictive waste processing scheduling  
- Nutrient enrichment based on crop feedback
