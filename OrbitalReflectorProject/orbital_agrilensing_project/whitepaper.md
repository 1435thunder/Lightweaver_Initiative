# Orbital Agrilensing Project (OAP) Whitepaper

## Abstract
This whitepaper outlines the design, purpose, and execution of orbital polarizing lens arrays engineered to support global agriculture.

## Goals
- Increase crop yields
- Reduce plant heat stress
- Save water
- Stabilize climate impacts on farming

## Approach
- Deploy large-scale, hexagonally tiled orbital reflectors with spectral filters
- Optimize light wavelength for crops (e.g., red/blue enhancement, IR filtering)
- Track Earth's rotation to maintain optimal field shading
- Implement deployable frames via in-orbit 2D mangle-printing

## Benefits
- Permanent drought mitigation
- No chemical geoengineering
- Precise, programmable global agricultural support

## Challenges
- Deployment logistics
- Orbital durability
- Ground coordination
