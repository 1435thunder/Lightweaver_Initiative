# The Light Is Ours
**Audience**: Engineers, scientists, policy makers  
**Tone**: Detailed, respectful, transparent

## Script Summary:
> "The sun provides 173,000 terawatts to Earth â€” 10,000x our needs.  
We use less than 0.01% of it.  
Not anymore.  
Through orbital reflectors, galvometric lenses, and layered lithography,  
we can now channel this energy like never before.  
The blueprints are free. The mission is open. The light is yours."

## Visuals:
- Technical diagrams overlayed on orbital arrays
- Solar flux maps shifting toward areas of need
- Teams fabricating metasurfaces, electrochromic panels, and deploying nanosats
